# Deep Learning applied to Spectral Imaging of Magnetic Noise

As a postdoc in **The City College of New York** (CCNY, USA), I have combined my experimental skills in quantum sensing along with artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. In collaboration with **University College London** (UCL, UK) and **Universidad Nacional de C√≥rdoba** (UNC, Argentina), we published a research article titled **Toward Deep-Learning-Assisted Spectrally Resolved Imaging of Magnetic Noise**, in the journal *Physical Review Applied* in 2022.

## Introduction

**Quantum sensing** is a powerful tool where the theory of quantum mechanics can be applied to measure physical properties, for example detecting subtle changes in magnetic fields with great precision. A well-established platform for this technology is the **nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond**, a specific type of defect within the diamond lattice, in which a nitrogen atom has replaced a carbon atom, next to a spot in which there is a missing carbon atom (vacancy). **This NV defect hosts a quantum system that is extremely sensitive to magnetic fields**, and can be manipulated optically to read out very small variations in the magnetic environment.

**Magnetic signals are usually convoluted with noise originated by random magnetic fluctuations**. This noise, typically seen as an obstacle for measurements, can also become a **valuable source of information**, as it may encode critical properties of the local composition and structure of a sample. Consequently, understanding and characterizing the **noise Power Spectral Density (PSD)** is a powerful tool to extract detailed information about a sample's physical properties.

The **problem of decoding magnetic noise** has a long history, and **traditional approaches**, which rely on theoretical models and numerical methods, have made significant progress in the area. However, they face **large limitations due to oversimplifications or to the extensive experimental data that is required**, compromising the accuracy of the results.

In our research, we address the challenge of **reconstructing the noise PSD from experimental magnetic measurements**, emphasizing the case of colored noise, where random magnetic fluctuations are mostly distributed within a reduced frequency range. The novelty of our work comes with the application of AI tools, showing that **Deep Learning algorithms can efficiently predict the noise PSD, employing a minimal experimental dataset**. Our results have benchmarked those of equivalent methodologies using only theoretical and numerical methods, highlighting the **great potential of combining AI-based methods with quantum sensing**.

## Deep Learning algorithm

In order to determine the noise PSD from magnetic signals, we have designed an **AI Autoencoder algorithm**. This program takes **magnetic timeseries as input data** and **determines the PSD of the underlying magnetic noise** in the frequency space. 

The idea behind the **autoencoding process** is to first **extract the essential information from the magnetic timeseries** into a reduced representation, and then **expand it to the frequency domain** to reconstruct the PSD of the magnetic noise. The main tools in the process are the **one-dimensional (1D) Convolutional Layers**, which scan the input data with 1D filters and **extract the most relevant features**. The Autoencoder algorithm consists in two main structures: first the **Encoder**, which combines 1D Convolutional Layers with **Max-Pooling layers to reduce the information in each step**, while preserving the critical features; and then the **Decoder**, which instead uses **Up-sampling layers to progressively expand the data**.

</figure></center>

Our algorithm has a **Deep Leaning structure** (meaning many internal layers) which **requires training on a large dataset**, having at least a few tens of thousands of samples. As our application aims to **predict the PSD of real magnetic measurements**, the ideal dataset would comprise a large collection of experimental measurements. However, acquiring a single timeseries sample can take several minutes, then **measuring just 10.000 samples would take more than a month**.

An **alternative solution for generating a large dataset** is to use **simulations** that reproduce the experimental conditions within a range of colored noises. Although simulations cannot perfectly replicate real-world conditions, the **AI algorithm** can still learn to **identify patterns and generalize its knowledge to real data**. In our work, we have simulated a **set of 500,000 samples**, 80% used for training and 20% for testing.

## Results

The colored noise studied in this work is within the range of tens to a few hundred kHz. At these frequencies, the **Hahn Echo control sequence** (an experimental technique) allows us to **measure the *relaxation time* of the NV defects** and to **determine the *coherence curve***, which goes from a state of maximum to minimum information regarding the quantum state of the NV defects. The shape of this coherence curve is **strongly affected by the magnetic noise**, which is the main principle that we use in our AI application for determining the PSD of each particular noise.

The following Figure illustrates **three examples of magnetic signals** presented as coherence curves (left column), each affected by a different colored noise. The real PSD is computed on the right by solid lines, exhibiting **distinct signatures for each colored noise**. When the input data is processed by our **Deep Learning algorithm**, the **PSD predictions** (green dashed lines in central column) **closely match the true PSD values**. For comparison, we include the results obtained through a **traditional approach** commonly used for this experimental technique (red dotted lines in right column). This method provides only a rough estimation of the noise PSD, but the **accuracy level is rather low**.

The results demonstrate that the **AI method** significantly **outperfoms its traditional counterpart**, achieving very accurate predictions. Furthermore, the **precision** level of the AI predictions can be **improved by using a larger training dataset**, while **designing more complex experiments** can unlock the analysis of **broader frequency ranges for the PSD**.

## Conclusions

In this research, we have developed an **AI autoencoder algorithm** that can be integrated with magnetic platforms, such as **NV centers in diamond**, to determine the Power Spectral Density of the noise behind a magnetic signal. The demonstrated superiority of our method over traditional solutions highlights the **great potential of AI applied to experimental techniques**. As determining the PSD for magnetic signals is key to several applications, the **AI algorithm can be tailored according to the problem's need** to achieve the desired accuracy, improving the efficiency known so far by other approaches.
