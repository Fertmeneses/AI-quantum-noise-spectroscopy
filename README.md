# Deep Learning applied to Spectral Imaging of Magnetic Noise

**[Website in development...]**

As a postdoc in **The City College of New York** (CCNY, USA), I combined my experimental skills in quantum sensing along with machine learning techniques. In collaboration with **University College London** (UCL, UK) and **Universidad Nacional de C√≥rdoba** (UNC, Argentina), we published a research article titled **Toward Deep-Learning-Assisted Spectrally Resolved Imaging of Magnetic Noise**, in the journal *Physical Review Applied* in 2022.

The full list of authors include:
* Fernando Meneses (CCNY).
* David F. Wise (UCL).
* Daniela Pagliero (CCNY).
* Pablo R. Zangara (UNC).
* Siddharth Dhomkar (UCL).
* Carlos A. Meriles (CCNY).

The main concept of the work was to we probe the response of **quantum defects in diamond** in the presence of a **magnetic environment** and implement a **deep neural network** to extract information about the **noise spectral density**. Our method was compared to traditional approaches, excluding artificial intelligence, demonstrating a **better performance and more precise results**.

## Introduction

Quantum sensing using diamonds (briefly)

Magnetic environments: noise as an obstacle or a signature.

Complex signals, theory and numerical methods are limited. Machine Learning approach could improve the precision in results.
