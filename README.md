# Deep Learning applied to Spectral Imaging of Magnetic Noise

**[Website in development...]**

As a postdoc in **The City College of New York** (CCNY, USA), I have combined my experimental skills in quantum sensing along with artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. In collaboration with **University College London** (UCL, UK) and **Universidad Nacional de C√≥rdoba** (UNC, Argentina), we published a research article titled **Toward Deep-Learning-Assisted Spectrally Resolved Imaging of Magnetic Noise**, in the journal *Physical Review Applied* in 2022.

The main concept of the work was to we probe the response of **quantum defects in diamond** in the presence of a **magnetic environment** and implement a **deep neural network** to extract information about the **noise spectral density**. Our artificial intelligence method was compared to traditional approaches, demonstrating a **better performance and more precise results**.

## Introduction

**Quantum sensing** is a powerful tool where the theory of quantum mechanics can be applied to measure physical properties, for example detecting subtle changes in magnetic fields with great precision. A well-established platform for this technology is the **nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond**, a specific type of defect within the diamond lattice, in which a nitrogen atom has replaced a carbon atom, next to a spot in which there is a missing carbon atom (vacancy). **This NV defect hosts a quantum system that is extremely sensitive to magnetic fields**, and can be manipulated optically to read out very small variations in the magnetic environment.

**Magnetic signals are usually convoluted with noise originated by random magnetic fluctuations**. This noise, tipycally seen as an obstacle for measurements, can also become a **valuable source of information**, as it may encode critical properties of the local composition and structure of a sample. Consequently, understanding and characterizing the **noise spectral density** is a powerful tool to extract detailed information about a sample's physical properties.

The **problem of decoding magnetic noise** has long been critical for many fields, as it is fundamental for practical applications. **Traditional approaches**, which rely on theoretical models and numerical methods, have made significant progress in the area, but they face **large limitations due to oversimplifications or the extensive experimental data that is required**, which usually compromises the accuracy of the results.

In our research, we address the challenge of **reconstructing the noise spectral density from experimental magnetic measurements**, emphasizing the case of colored noise, where random magnetic fluctuations are mostly distributed within a frequency range. The novelty of our work comes with the application of artificial intelligence tools, showing that **deep learning algorithms can efficiently reconstruct the noise spectral density, employing a minimal experimental dataset**. Our results have benchmarked those of equivalent methodologies using only theoretical and numerical methods, highlighting the **great potential of combining AI-based methods with quantum sensing**.

## Deep Learning algorithm

For the task of determining the Power Spectral Density (PSD) from magnetic signals, we have designed an **AI algorithm** that takes **magnetic timeseries as input data** and **returns the PSD of the underlying magnetic noise** in the frequency space.
