# Deep Learning applied to Spectral Imaging of Magnetic Noise

**[Website in development...]**

As a postdoc in **The City College of New York** (CCNY, USA), I combined my experimental skills in quantum sensing along with machine learning techniques. In collaboration with **University College London** (UCL, UK) and **Universidad Nacional de C√≥rdoba** (UNC, Argentina), we published a research article titled **Toward Deep-Learning-Assisted Spectrally Resolved Imaging of Magnetic Noise**, in the journal *Physical Review Applied* in 2022.

* Fernando Meneses (CCNY).
* David F. Wise (UCL).
* Daniela Pagliero (CCNY).
* Pablo R. Zangara (UNC).
* Siddharth Dhomkar (UCL).
* Carlos A. Meriles (CCNY).

The main concept of the work was to we probe the response of **quantum defects in diamond** in the presence of a **magnetic environment** and implement a **deep neural network** to extract information about the **noise spectral density**. Our artificial intelligence method was compared to traditional approaches, demonstrating a **better performance and more precise results**.

## Introduction

**Quantum sensing** is a powerful tool where the theory of quantum mechanics can be applied to measure physical properties such as magnetic fields, detecting subtle changes with great precision. A well-established platform for this technology is the **nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond**, a specific type of defect within the diamond atomic lattice, in which a nitrogen atom has replaced a carbon atom, next to a spot in which there is a missing carbon atom (vacancy). **This NV defect hosts a quantum system that is extremely sensitive to magnetic fields**, and can be manipulated optically to read out very small variations in the magnetic environment.

**Quantum sensing** is often employed to map the properties of magnetic samples, which is a challenging task because of the **relevant signals are mixed with random magnetic fluctuations**, known as **magnetic noise**. This noise, tipycally seen as an obstacle for measurements, can also become a **valuable source of information**, as it may encode critical properties of the local sample composition and dynamics. Consequently, understanding and characterizing the **noise spectral density** is a powerful tool to extract detailed information about the sample's physical properties.
